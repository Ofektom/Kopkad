## ⏳ PENDING (10%)

### Backend Service Layer Updates

The following services need the same flexible business filtering pattern applied:

#### Pattern to Follow:

```python
async def get_some_data(
    business_id: int | None = None,  # ← Add this parameter
    # ... other params ...
    current_user: dict,
    db: Session
):
    # Use business_id if provided, else active_business_id
    target_business_id = business_id or current_user.get("active_business_id")

    # Validate and filter
    # (See BUSINESS_SWITCHING_IMPLEMENTATION_STATUS.md lines 48-119)
```

#### Files Needing Update:

1. **`service/payments.py`**

   - `get_customer_payments()`
   - `get_payment_accounts()`
   - `get_payment_requests()` (if exists)

2. **`service/expenses.py`**

   - `get_expense_cards()`
   - `get_expenses()`
   - `get_expense_stats()`

3. **`service/business.py`**

   - `get_business_users()`

4. **API Endpoints** - Add `business_id` query parameter:
   - `api/payments.py`
   - `api/expenses.py`
   - `api/business.py`

**Time Estimate:** 2-3 hours  
**Pattern:** Fully documented in `BUSINESS_SWITCHING_IMPLEMENTATION_STATUS.md`

## 🚀 Ready to Use Features

### What Works RIGHT NOW:

1. ✅ **Login** - Returns businesses and sets active business
2. ✅ **Business Switching** - Dropdown in sidebar works
3. ✅ **Token Management** - New token with business context
4. ✅ **Savings Data** - Filtered by active business automatically
5. ✅ **Metrics Dashboard** - Shows total + per-business breakdown
6. ✅ **Mobile & Desktop** - Responsive UI for both views

### What Works with Limitations:

- **Payments, Expenses, Business User endpoints** - Currently use old logic
  - Will show data from ALL businesses (not filtered by active business yet)
  - Still functional, just not business-scoped yet
  - Can be updated incrementally using documented pattern

---

## 🎯 Quick Start Testing

### 1. Start Backend

```bash
cd /Users/decagon/Documents/Ofektom/savings-system
# Activate venv and run
uvicorn main:app --reload --port 8001
```

### 2. Start Frontend

```bash
cd /Users/decagon/Documents/Ofektom/kopkad-frontend
npm run dev
```

### 3. Test Login

- Login with account that has multiple businesses
- Check sidebar - should see business switcher
- Check metrics - should show 5 cards

### 4. Test Switch

- Click business dropdown in sidebar
- Select different business
- Page should reload
- Metrics should update

### 5. Browser Console Check

```javascript
// Should see these values
localStorage.getItem("active_business_id"); // e.g., "100"
JSON.parse(localStorage.getItem("user_data")).businesses; // Array
JSON.parse(localStorage.getItem("user_data")).active_business_id; // e.g., 100
```

## 🎓 Key Learnings

### Architecture Decisions:

1. **Token-based context** - Active business in JWT eliminates need for business_id in every request
2. **Flexible fallback** - Explicit business_id param allows overrides when needed
3. **Login-time data** - Businesses returned at login eliminates extra API calls
4. **Role-based logic** - Different roles have appropriate access patterns

### Best Practices Applied:

- Secure validation at every step
- Clean separation of concerns
- Reusable components
- Comprehensive error handling
- User-friendly feedback
